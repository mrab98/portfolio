## Folder Contents and Information

### Folder Description:
This folder houses essential files discussed in the 'Support Information' section, aimed at aiding users in understanding the contents and purpose of the folder.

### File Descriptions:

#### Imp.m:
Imp.m serves as a Matlab Class designed for signal processing and feature extraction. It plays a pivotal role in supporting the functionalities of the (FeatureExtraction.mlx)/(HTML) files, as well as the (main.m) file. These files heavily rely on Imp.m for tasks related to signal processing and feature extraction.

#### FeatureExtraction.mlx/(HTML) :
These utilize the capabilities of the (Imp.m) Matlab Class to carry out signal processing and extract essential features.

#### main.m:
main.m is a Matlab script that utilize the (Imp.m) Matlab Class. This script mainly centers around signal processing utilizing the methods of the (Imp.m) Class.

#### CNN.ipynb :
CNN.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook file dedicated to damage detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It provides a platform for implementing and experimenting with CNN-based algorithms for damage detection tasks using TensorFlow package

#### damagedetection.ipynb :
This Jupyter Notebook file, (damagedetection.ipynb), is tailored for damage detection purposes as well. It explores and demonstrates the application of Support Vector Classification (SVC) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) algorithms within the context of damage detection using TensorFlow and SKLearn packages.
