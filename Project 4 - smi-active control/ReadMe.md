# Fuzzy Logic-Based Vibration Control of SDOF Structures with MR Dampers and Actuators:
## Overview
   In this project, I designed and implemented a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) in MATLAB for vibration control using a Magnetorheological (MR) damper(using the modified bouc wen model) and an actuator. I compared the performance of passive, semi-active, and active control systems for single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) structures. I used MATLAB and Simulink to simulate the model. This project required an understanding of vibration and control principles to model the dynamics and interactions of the structure and the controller.
