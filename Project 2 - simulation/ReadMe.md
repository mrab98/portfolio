Project 2: Numerical Simulation and Model Updating
# Project description:
  In this project, I conducted a simulation of the test using COMSOL Multi-physics.
  The simulation involved two different physics due to the behaviour of the 
  piezoelectric transducer (Electrical field and structural mechanics) and the
  determination of electrostatic properties and solid material properties was 
  crucial in the modelling process. This process also involved optimizing the 
  damping and elasticity modulus of the steel structure in the numerical model 
  by fine-tune these parameters to best fit the observed data. The careful 
  modelling of different physical properties and the optimization process required
  skills in numerical modelling and knowledge of physics behind the test.
